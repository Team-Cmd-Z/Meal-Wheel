Elizabeth: Technical skills. React, JS, etc.
KC: REACT, data-flow, CSS
Elaine: Back-end development, working with various services and learning to use Oauth (auth0) 
**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?**
 Stand-up meetings first thing every morning. Talk about where we are, what needs to happen that day. 
End of every day : review what our priorities will be the  following day.

**NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.**
#### Conflict Plan

**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**
Communication: being honest and giving constructive criticism when needed. 
Understanding everyone’s circumstances 
Keeping criticism respectful
**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**
Communication will be key here, we are all open to direct honesty. If someone is taking all the control, we may ask for specific goals and tasks to handle ourselves - so we will assign ourselves work.
**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**
We will balance each other's weaknesses with our strengths and if someone is struggling we will help that team member reach the solution.
**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**
We’ll address the issue. Help them find a task.
**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**
If unsuccessful, speak with an instructor to understand the situation and what next steps will be taken
#### Communication Plan

**What hours will you be available to communicate?**
Normal class hours 
**What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**
Slack and remo
email
**How often will you take breaks?**
Take lunch break and breaks in between as needed
Members can communicate their breaks in remo/slack
**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**
Utilize TAs, Audrey, and Sheyna. Ask help when needed - 15 minute rule. Have serious conversations about limiting our feature tasks so that we have more attainable goals.
**How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**
Using remo and slack
**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**
Daily stand-up meetings where everyone has a chance to speak, check up on each other throughout the day to see how we are each doing.
**How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**
Including everyone in the conversation and asking for each other’s opinions when making decisions for the project. Keeping everyone in the loop if they are not available at the time 
#### Work Plan
**Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.**


NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

**How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**
Using trello and daily standup to know what daily goals are and how each person will contribute to each day.


**What project management tool will be used?**
Figma - FigJam.
